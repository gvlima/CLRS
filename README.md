## Algorithms

This repository contains solutions for all exercises and problems in the book Introduction to Algorithms, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein (commonly referred to as CLRS).

The main goal of this repository is to serve as personal challenge, focusing on building a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures.
